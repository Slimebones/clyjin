System configuration toolbox

## ARCHIVED
I had an idea to apply Golang-style approach of Functional programming, but a lot of concepts i found really complicated in implementing, e.g. how Python exceptions work.

I think it is better not to reinvent the wheel and implement these toolbox ideas in Golang itself.
